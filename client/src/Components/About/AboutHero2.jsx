              When you join a Google Developer Group, youâ€™ll have the
              opportunity to meet local developers with similar interests in
              technology. A GDG meetup event includes talks on a wide range of
              technical topics where you can learn new skills through hands-on
              workshops. The community prides itself on being an inclusive
              environment where everyone and anyone interested in tech - from
              beginner developers to experienced professionals - all are welcome
              to join.
